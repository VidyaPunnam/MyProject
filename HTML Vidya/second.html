        <h3>Shiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti, the Hindu 
            trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu.[2][14] In the Shaivite tradition, 
            Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.[9][10][11] 
        In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme
         Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative <br>power (Shakti) and the equal 
         complementary partner of Shiva.[15][16] Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in
          Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.[17]</h3>
